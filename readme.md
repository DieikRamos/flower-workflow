## Features

- Define workflows using YAML schemas
- Execute workflows with dependencies between steps
- Support for custom actions
- Built-in HTTP request and basic mapping actions
- Concurrent execution of independent steps
- Dynamic parameter parsing and evaluation


## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use Flower:

```python
from flower import Flower

# Initialize Flower with your schema files
flower = Flower(["path/to/your/schema.yaml"])

# Run a workflow
result = flower.run("your_workflow_name", {"param1": "value1", "param2": "value2"})
```

## Core Components

### Flower

The main class that initializes the workflow engine with schema files and custom actions.

### FlowerRunner

Responsible for executing workflows, managing step dependencies, and handling the execution context.

### Schema

Represents the structure of your workflows, including context, actions, and workflow definitions.

### ActionProtocol

A protocol that defines the interface for custom actions.

## Built-in Actions

- **HttpRequest**: Performs HTTP requests with customizable parameters.
- **BasicMapping**: A simple action for parameter mapping.

## Extending Flower

You can extend Flower by creating custom actions:

1. Create a class that implements the `ActionProtocol`.
2. Define the `__call__` method with the signature `(self, context, workflow_context, params)`.
3. Add your custom action when initializing Flower:

```python
from flower import Flower
from your_module import YourCustomAction

flower = Flower(
    ["path/to/your/schema.yaml"],
    actions={"your_custom_action": YourCustomAction()}
)
```
